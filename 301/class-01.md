# Objects and Inheritance

JavaScript objects use prototype-based inheritance. Its design is logically similar (but different in implementation) from class inheritance in strictly Object Oriented Programming languages like Java and C#.

It can be loosely described by saying that when methods or properties are attached to object’s prototype they become available for use on that object and its descendants, but not directly attached to them.

When you use class and extends keywords internally JavaScript will still use prototype-based inheritance. It just simplifies the syntax (this is often called “Syntactic Sugar”). While classes are easier to use, it’s still very important to understand how prototype-based inheritance works. It’s still at the core of the language design.
